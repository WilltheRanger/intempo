# InTempo Audio Tuning Log

Populated during Batch 3. Format spec: see "Batch 3 Tuning Appendix"
in intempo-combined.md. Every threshold change logs old value, new
value, regression results across all six fixture clips, and rationale.

## 2026-07-24 — Baseline: config.toml shipped with spec §4 STARTING values (untuned)

This is the starting point, not a tuning result. `backend/config.toml`
was created with the spec's default numbers, none of them yet validated
against real recordings:

- `onset.delta = 0.07`, `pre_max = 20`, `post_max = 20`, `wait_ms = 60`
- `onset.double_bass.delta = 0.05`, `highpass_hz = 80.0`
- tolerance bands symmetric: inner 5% / mid 10% / outer 20% (rushing == dragging)
- `alignment.warn_quality = 0.7`, `broken_quality = 0.4`, `sakoe_chiba_band = 0.2`
- `trend.window = 8`

**Not yet done (blocks closing the Batch 3 DoD):**
1. Record the six-clip corpus (01_detache_clean … 06_pizzicato) per the
   Tuning Appendix.
2. Set the tolerance bands empirically by ear (Appendix step 6). Expect
   the rushing/dragging bands to end up asymmetric — the config already
   has separate keys for each so tuning is a value change, no code edit.
3. Tune `delta` / `wait` against the slurred and pizzicato clips.

Every one of those changes gets its own entry below, with clip-by-clip
regression results. Until then, verdicts are directionally correct
(the pipeline is unit-tested) but the exact thresholds are provisional.
